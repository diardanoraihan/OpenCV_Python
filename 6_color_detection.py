    .bitwise_and will take two source images and blend them using a mask.
    In our case, we only have one source image, so we pass the second source with the same one.

    >> 1 1 = 1
    >> 1 0 = 0
    >> 0 1 = 0
    >> 0 0 = 0
    As you can see, we compare the bits from our mask to the bits in our image.
    And, if this return 1, it means there is a blue color. Otherwise, we don't keep it.

Pro Tips
--------
In order to get the upper and lower bound of a specific color, you can go 
to HSV color picker and pick a light and darker color of your interest.
